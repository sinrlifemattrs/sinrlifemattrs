### Brief 💼📝

> I am a '93 who enjoys working on all things tech. ⚙️👨‍💻
>
> Digital computing and social media interaction can be
> extremely toxic or very healthy for the any modern citizen. 😞 vs 🙂 
>
> Unregulated netting may benefit some industries temporarily, however
> it does not always benefit the consumer and especially not always for
> families. 🙈🙉🙊
>
> There is evidence to suggest there are correlations between various 
> social-computing unwellness, society-wide issues, and also lost
> business. 📉📊
> 
> Social-computing addictions problems are growing, and computer
> related social problems are too per active user. 📈💔
>
> What the heck are computers for? 💻⁉️
> What they heck is the dominating goals of computing? ⏰🏆
> What is wrong with the tech ecosystem? 🤦‍♂️🏞️
>

### The Proposition 🥚🎼

> Here's a good example of an Emotional Context Use Case Diagram 🏗️📝
>

![](/diagrams/Emotional-Context-Use-Case-Diagram.jpg)

### The Proposition Continued 🐣🤔

> Why does this matter? 🤔🧐
>
> We are not mapping the internet as a public scenario to reality. ⚖️🥴
>
> Why are there somethings done online we would not do in public? 🙈⚖️
>
> Emotional fatigue online is becoming an issue. 👀😩
>
> Digitally enhanced pathologies are also. 🤕🤪
>

### The Future and the Various Tiers of Social Computing 🧐💗

![](/diagrams/Application-Tiers.jpg)

> We have seen what this can do badly on our own planet!? 🪖🌎
>
> What can we do repair our socio-emtional and own digital age? 🤨🤕
> 
> What can we do to enhance the future generation? 🔮🌐
>

### The Abstract [Computers for What?] ☺️🤲

> Abstract variation of social constructs adds a level of abstraction to life we are not embuing into the laws and honesty of daily life. 🏠👨‍⚖️
>
> The faithfulness of the family is disappearing for the self-righteosness of the individuals freedom to do untraditional things online. 🔥💻
>
> Essentially we have built beautiful roads and constructed magnificent places to grow without foresight on emotional integrity, safety & growth. 😎⁉️
>
> Those who have families, seek healthy lineages, and consumer base, even areligiously, people can agree a moral technical aptitude is vital. 🩺🥶
>
> From a technical vantage a computer is a smart kids hammer, beautiful when used right and rotten when used wrong, recall, reality is foundational. 🧠⁉️
>
> It yields power over others due to our ubiquitous implementation of technology. 🌎🌍🌏
>
> To be wise device: vitality, ubiquitousness, and moral aptitudes are being ignored for lazy or selfish reasons. 👿🤑
>
> Society-wide problem related to collective bargaining towards strong family values and societies, seem to be declining. 📉🧑‍🧑‍🧒‍🧒
>
> Overall the business world is suffering slightly, quality and worst-case; people lost in addiction. 🖥️🚭
>
> Due to the inherent agression and failings of pirate industries, we do not map public social rulings to be reflected digitally. ⚖️⁉️
>
> A crude example would be the laws surrouding real-world ludity laws versus similar closed-world imagery being shed publicly online. 💩🌪️
>
> Similar crude examples include: gambling, nudity, violence and more. 💩🔥

#### [Society and Computing?] 👤⚖️

> I truly believe solving this issue, is the same as by-laws and normal regulations in everyday-society. 👤👏
>
> If you look into the itemization of allowed and disallowed behaviour in society, mapping them together from the real-life perspective is good. ⚖️🤞
>
> Also, resolving societal dystopian futures would be required to maintain a strong and healthy society. 🔮🌳
>
> We are ignoring the reverse mapping of the effects of the internet mapping back into real life. 🔂😩
>
> People need to be educated or communicated about the utility of computing and social-computing. ❤️📚
>
> At some point, the cost of permitting hyper liberal computing will vastly outweigh the gained "liberties" people are receiving. 🔓🤥

#### [Net Gain Computing?] 🥇💻

> Businesses gain and institutions succeed when society is healthy, a known attribution throughout history. Computing must help not harm us. 🎶👂
>
> Should computing "liberties" as aforementioned in the previous paragraph, a sinister failout of culture and tradition could ensue. 🔥🌪️
>
> A net gain morally and some kind of moral aptitude for services and tools should be obtained by a collective of standardization professionals. 🧳❤️
>
> Like music or movies, computer usage should be a safe-to-use practice where consumers make their decisions with critical thinking. 🧐🎶
>
> Being in the focus zone of a computational device can be somewhat mesmerizing, so being careful about that common practice is good. 👨‍💻⚠️

### Surface 🪜🔨

> So one of my central concerns is disseminating technology and working with data that allows the family unit to thrive and feel good on the net. ✅🏗️
>
> Low stress and high efficacy computing is important in the user-world as it is in the computing world. 💻👀
>
> Why aren't moral-emotional business models involving customer base continuancy aptitude via graphic-modeling or graphic-gravity checking done? 🪐📊
>
> A gravity-map of user familiarity, usage and abusing levels could be formed using hashes and-or employee-customer UEBA systems. 🌝💡
>
> Example: TikTok's take a break functionality. 🧩😍
>
> Example: Discord's NSF* functionality. 😱⏭️

### Goals ⌚️🌐

> Short Term Goals Include: 💡🏦
>   * using machine learning and artificial intelligence for good 💻📊
>   * textual abstraction and simplification of large datasets [soft serve] 🍦📊
>   * capturing unsafe data and information to summarize socially 0️⃣1️⃣
>   * nullify the harmful effects of bad data that cause bad habits 🔎🚫
>   * give consumers the full builtin powers of parenting for their kids 🏗️🧑‍🧑‍🧒
>   * construct consumer level kids filth proof devices 🚫💩
>
> The culminating goals is protecting people online 🤺🛡️👨👩👶👶
>
> Context is everything and many people are suffering out there. 😫😭
>
> Bad digital and life contexts and habits can lead to health problems and hurting culture. 💌 + 🖥️
>
> Digital limbo and bad data should be the computing past so the future holds promise and bravery. 🫡💗
